## Elizabeth Keys / Reflection


1. **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**  
  * I was struggling to understand the git fetch and git merge commands in relation to git pull, and in what context you may use one method or the other. Mostly, the context of demands and why one is appropriate in a specific instance, but perhaps not in another.

2. **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**  
  * I learned that when you are working as a team on a repository, if your teammate creates a pull request and merges it to the repository, it will merge into yours. Since we had not really experienced a team repository setting, it was good to see how pull and merge requests worked while someone else is making changes. I did confirm my thoughts about the difference between git fetch/merge and git pull, as well!

3. **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**  
  * I asked for some more information about when it's appropriate to use a new feature branch for your work. If you're working alone on a website, and you make changes to two different html files, for instance, should you create a branch for each, or is it okay to make changes to multiple files in a single branch -- adding a form on one page and adding nav links on another, for instance. 

4. **What still confuses you about Git?**  
  * I think I still struggle a bit with understanding context of some of the commands, -u or git pull for example. Although I have an understanding of what they mean, it's hard to know when/how they are used in context of working on a project without having more experience with it.

5. **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**  
  * I was very nervous, but I realized that it's definitely not as nervewracking as I thought it would be. I will say that I realized that I need to learn to allow someone else to lead me more, because I felt when I was the driver that I wasn't allowing the navigator to lead me enough, and our guide did mention that in verbal feedback, so it confirmed that thought for me. I think I struggle a bit with helping someone to understand something without just giving them the answer, I naturally tend to lead or drive, if you will, so I need to work on that in my time here at DBC.
