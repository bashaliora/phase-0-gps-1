**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
We clarified the importance of the different Git commands from  branches, pull requests, fetch/merge, and merge conflicts.

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
For the most part, I had a good grasp about Git, until I stumble upon the Git fetch and merge.  It was my fault though because I wasn't able to read ahead of time, so I was a little confused when we were going over it. When we did the work on terminal, it made more sense.  I just think a little more research will make me feel more comfortable to get the concept down.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
One question that I had to ask was the Git fetch and merge.  We thought hard to get a better understanding of these new terminology.  What we figured out is that git fetch is simply gathering new data from the remote repository, but it doesn't mess around with other working files. If you want that to happen, a Git merge would be necessary to transfer the new data to the working or local repository. Thus, creating a Git pull.

**What still confuses you about Git?**
I feel that little by little I am understanding Git each and everyday. I'm not as confused. I think it's more of just digging deeper, so I can completely understand each Git command and feel more comfortable with this new system.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
I enjoyed my first GPS pairing! I definitely learned a few new things and picked up some mistakes that I need to review on my personal time. My partner was super helpful and was very patient with me through out the session.  I can say the same for the instructor who also kept us informed and gave us the necessary steps to complete our first GPS session.  Overall, I felt that I can do much better and be more prepared for the next GPS pair up.
